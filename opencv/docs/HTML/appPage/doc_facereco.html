      Description</H1>


    <P>It is an overview of HMMDemo application. See also <a href="./hmmdemo.htm">hypertext manual</a> on it.


    <P>This face recognition tool gives the computer the ability to
      recognize a face from image files (BMP format) or directly from an USB
    camera. The system requirements for this application are a Pentium&reg
      processor-based computer and Microsoft* Windows* NT 4.0, 98, or 2000.  The face
      recognition uses the </a>
      <a href="../functPage/functPage.htm#RECOGNITION" target="function window">
    embedded hidden Markov model</A> and implements the method described in 
      <A HREF="avbpa99.ps">"Face recognition using an embedded HMM" </A>.

      Adds a face to the training set. The rectangle in the right panel
      should bound the user's face. If the rectangle is misplaced or does
      not exist, create one by left-click and dragging a rectangle. If the
      left panel is not focused on a particular user, a dialog box will
      appear. In this box enter the name of the captured face. If the left
      panel is focused (by double-clicking a face) on a person, the captured
      face will automatically be added to the current set.

      How to...</H2>

    <H3>
      Create a new face database</H3>

    Click button [3] on the toolbar to create the file where the database
    information is stored. Specify the filename and database description
    in the dialog box.
    <BR>
    To add images from camera or file to the face database, specify the
    rectanglular area bounding the face by left-click and dragging. Then
    click button [4] to add the face to the database. In the dialog box,
    enter the name of the captured face. The left panel will automatically
    focus on the set for this particular person. Incorrect images can be
    removed by cselecting the image and clicking button [5]. To restart
    the video after a face image was added to the database, click button
    [8]. Use the File menu, option Save to save the database file.  

    <H3>
      Open an existing face database</H3>

    Click button [2] on the toolbar to specify the file where the database
    information is stored. One image for each person in the database will
    be displayed on the left panel. To view all the images of a particular
    person, double-click the specific face. All the images in the database
    representing the specified person are displayed in the left panel. To
    return to the previous screen, double-click on any white space in the
    left panel.

    <H3>
      Train a face model</H3>

    <P>After capturing several instances for a person, train the face
      model for that person by clicking button [10]. The models can be
      trained one by one or all at a once. To train one person, double-click
      the person to be trained and click button [10]. To train everyone,
      make sure the left panel is not focused by double-clicking any
      whitespace in the left panel and click button [10]. Note that when an
      image is added or deleted from a particular set, that set needs to be
      retrained.  

    <H3>
      Recognize from live video or from file on disk</H3>

    If all the people in the database are trained, faces can be
    recognized.  To recognize a face from a camera view or from a file,
    first create a bounding box in the right panel by left-click and
    dragging. Then click button [12] to run the recognition algorithm.
    The recognition results box will list in order of likelihood the three
    people most likely to match the image. The image in the left panel
    corresponding to the most likely person will also be shown in a with a
    colored border. The test image can also be added to the database by
    clicking button [4].  In this case, the corresponding model must be
    retrained.
