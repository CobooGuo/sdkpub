The current libs work for local functionality on OSX - see the keytest.cpp program.  I never tested 
network functionality (yet) because the lib2017 versions for win64 crash some of the time in 
the same simple test of finding and logging on to the key.  So at present I reverted the
sdkbuild.pl script so that it is referencing the previous set of libraries and we're
using the UniKey STD instead while I work on a software-based license approach.

Originally the netowrk version of the library for OSX did not work.  See emails to dragos and cynthia 
starting 7 Aug 2017.  They sent a couple updated libraries until the simple tests passed.

These files from the SDK downloaded Aug 2017 to test network functionality of UniKey PRO & Time models.

The header was renamed from UniKey.h to UniKeyFR.h to maintain consistency with previous versions of the SDK
and not have to modify various build scripts, at least until/if we make a decision to upgrade which key
and libraries we are using.
