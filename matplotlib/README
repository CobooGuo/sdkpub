This folder is an attempt to provide matplotlib functionality to C++ programs via an embedded Python
interpreter using matplotlib libraries with additional matplotlib toolkits.

There was already a python folder in sdkpub added by Ken I think, but it is older, contains a library
for win32 only, and does not contain matplotlib.  The intent here is to provide specifically matplotlib
for both OSX and win32/win64, such that adding this sdk to your project dependencies will make available
matplotlib and associated toolkits.

This is used for KinTek software to provide the ability to output EPS/postscript plots, where easily
modifiable python scripts are executed by the C++ software to generate the output.

You can also use this SDK if you just need to embed Python 2.7.11 in an OSX or win32/64 app.  Linux
support should be trivial to add with a ./configure && make type build in sdkbuild.pl.
