28-Dec-2000 - Built from CLAPACK V3 from www.netlib.org

Master workspace is clapack.dsw. Always start VC++ with this. 

Files in this tree replace the corresponding files in the 
CLAPACK V3 distribution. 

Projects are set for Multithreaded DLL for the C Runtime

Many many compiler warnings about ambiguous operator precedence 
involving << and >> operators. However, amazingly, the package passes 
all of the tests. I supressed some warnings with an edit to 
f2c.h -- see the #pragma warning statement there.

There are 3 files in which the compiler warning led to a 
clear error -- in libf77: pow_hh.c, pow_ii.c, pow_qq.c
have divide by 0:

     return x == 0 ? 1/x : 0;

should be

     return x == 0 ? 0 : 1/x;

Also, the code in slamch.c and dlamch.c is very fussy and needs to have
compiler optimizations turned off.

The timer filed dsecnd.c and second.c are modified to use the Win32
timing facilities.

I spent a ton of time making GUI project files for all of the
parts. They are set for dependencies, however, this is the 
suggested build order:

(1)  libF77
(2)  libI77
(3)  BLAS
(4)  The BLAS test drivers xblat?? (there are 8)
(5)  Run BLAS tests via blastest.bat ("blas test files" project)

Milestone 1 -- All of the CLAPACK support libraries are built
               and tested.

(6)  CLAPACK
(7)  TMGLIB (used by tests)
(8)  The LINear test progs xlintst? (there are 4)
(9)  Run the LINear tests via testlin.btm (clapack test files proj.)
(10) The EIGenvalue test progs xeigtst? (there are 4)
(11) Run the EIGenvalue tests via testlin.btm (clapack test files proj.)

Milestone 2 -- CLAPACK has been checked out and is ready for use.
