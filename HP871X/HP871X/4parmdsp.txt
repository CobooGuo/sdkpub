
4-Parameter Display Demo Program
Rev A.01.00

This HP VEE demo program uses the HP 871x Plug&Play driver to display 
all four S-parameters simultaneously on the computer's screen.  For 
best results, the computer's display resolution should be at least 
1024 x 768.  This program will only function with an 8712ES or 
8714ES.   

In this program, the Plug&Play driver has a VEE device name of "VNA".
VEE will report that the device "VNA" needs to be configured; this 
means that the HP 871x Plug&Play driver needs to be selected and 
configured for the device name "VNA" (Advanced I/O Config... button).
Once the program has been loaded into VEE, DO NOT PRESS THE RUN BUTTON!
Instead, use the four control buttons at the bottom of the screen to 
control the analyzer as described below.

PRESET 871xES - Presets Analyzer to default conditions and selects the 
	default two-port calibration.

SETUP ANALYZER - Allows the user to select start/stop frequencies, 
	number of points, bandwidth, and more.  The scale and 
	reference selections only affect the analyzer's display, not
	the computer's display.

CALIBRATE - Allows the user to perform a two-port calibration.  Before
	the calibration begins, the program will display the cal kit
        choices and the user must click on the cal kit to be used.

GET DATA - This will start the process of gathering and displaying of 
	data.  THIS IS AN ENDLESS LOOP!  To stop the data gathering, 
	press the STOP button on the HP VEE control bar.
