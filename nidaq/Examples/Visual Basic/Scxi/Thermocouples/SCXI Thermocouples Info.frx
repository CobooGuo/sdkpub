ÿæ	Cold Junction Compensation (CJC) is necessary when making temperature 
measurements using thermocouples.  The thermocouple itself relies on the principle that 
an electrical potential exists at the junction of two different metals.  The amount of this 
potential varies with temperature.  When using a thermocouple we measure the voltage 
potential across the thermocouple and can calculate the temperature causing this 
potential difference.

CJC becomes necessary because the junction between each end of the thermocouple 
and your measuring system (connector block, terminal block) also adds a potential 
difference to the thermocouple voltage. To compensate for this added potential we 
must know the temperature at the junction between the thermocouple and your 
measuring system.  This temperature is measure using a CJC sensor. This is a 
temperature sensor different than a thermocouple, and commonly used types are IC 
(integrated circuit) sensors and thermistors.

To make our actual thermocouple temperature measurement we measure the voltage 
from the thermocouple and CJC sensor. Then we convert the CJC sensor measurement 
into a CJC temperature and pass the thermocouple voltage and CJC temperature to our 
conversion function to calculate the thermocouple temperature.

Many of the SCXI and other terminal blocks include CJC sensors that are addressed 
using a special channel string.  The following terminal blocks use an IC sensor: 
AMUX-64T, SCXI-1300, SCXI-1320, SCXI-1321, and SC-207X series. The following 
terminal blocks use a thermistor: SCXI-1303, SCXI-1322, SCXI 1327, and SCXI-1328. 
Specifying the CJC sensor in your channel string will depend on the device or SCXI 
module your are using. For terminal blocks directly connected to a data acquisition 
device such as the AMUX-64T and SC-207X series you configure the temperature 
sensor using a jumper on the terminal block and specify the onboard channel such as 0 
to measure the CJC sensor.  When you use an SCXI module and terminal block you 
define a special channel (‘mtemp’, ‘dtemp’, or cjtemp’) depending on the module (see 
below) you are using. The final channel string would include the chassis and module 
number as well.

e.g. ‘ob0!sc1!md1!mtemp’

‘mtemp’ is used by the following modules: SCXI-1100, SCXI-1120 (multiplexed), 
SCXI-1121 (multiplexed), and SCXI-1122. 

‘dtemp’ is used on the following modules: SCXI-1120 (parallel) and SCXI-1121 (parallel).

‘cjtemp’ is used on the SCXI-1102 module.
