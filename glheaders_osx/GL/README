osx stopped including X11 with Mountain Lion in 2012.  So new installs will not have GL headers where we
normally expect to find them (/usr/X11R6/include).  A better way to fix this perhaps is to do

#ifdef __APPLE__
	#include "OpenGL/gl.h"
	#include "OpenGL/glu.h"
#endif

but this means editing much of zbslib and a bazillion plugs, so instead I'm creating this folder
and putting the handful of headers you need and including this folder in the include path for
osx builds only.  The libs aren't needed; they are part of the OpenGL framework that we reference
in the Makefile.
